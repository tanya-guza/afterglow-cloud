# This shell script invokes AfterGlow [1] with the settings given as arguments
# and generates a GIF graph image of the resulting output from Afterglow; using
# neato, dot or sfdp [2]. 
#
# Usage:
# 	afterglow.sh "path_to_csv_file" "path_to_colour_property_file" 
#				"path_to_resulting_output_file" 
#				"path_to_afterglow.pl" "filter name" "arguments"
#
# Note: Paths can be absolute or relative.
# 		For a list of 'arguments' please see [1].
#
# Example usage: ./afterglow.sh data/firewall.csv sample.properties images/firewall.gif afterglow/src/afterglow.pl neato -d -e 1.5
#
# Exit status:
#	0: On successful image creation.
#	1: Error creating an output image.
#	2: No valid data file supplied.
#	3: No valid property file supplied.
#	4: Perl is not installed $PATH.
#	5: Neato/Sfdp/Dot [2] is not installed $PATH.
#	6: Afterglow.pl [1] is not present.
